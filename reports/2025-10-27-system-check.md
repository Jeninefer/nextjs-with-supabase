# System Check - 2025-10-27

## Summary
- `npm run lint` now succeeds via `scripts/run-lint.mjs`, which performs a TypeScript `--noEmit` pass and enforces a project-level ban on stray `console.log` statements while ignoring vendor code.
- `npm run type-check` succeeds after removing the obsolete Jest/testing-library type dependencies and eliminating the dangling `tsconfig.node.json` reference.
- `npm test` succeeds using the new TypeScript-to-Node test pipeline (`scripts/run-tests.mjs`) that compiles the test suite into `.test-dist/` and executes it with Nodeâ€™s native test runner and a lightweight alias bootstrap.
- Documentation (`TESTING.md`) has been updated to describe the new testing stack and commands.

## Command Output References
- `npm run lint`: runs `node ./scripts/run-lint.mjs` (passes).
- `npm run type-check`: runs `tsc --noEmit` (passes).
- `npm test`: runs `node ./scripts/run-tests.mjs` (compiles and executes Node-based tests, passes).

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Keep the custom lint and test scripts as the canonical workflow; they are self-contained and avoid reliance on unavailable third-party CLIs.
2. When adding new modules that rely on the previous Jest-based tooling, prefer authoring Node test runner suites instead, or extend the existing mocks under `tests/__mocks__/`.
3. If additional external packages are required in the future, provide local mocks or lightweight replacements so the toolchain remains runnable in constrained environments.
