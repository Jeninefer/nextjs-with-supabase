# System Check - 2025-10-27

## Summary
- `npm run lint` fails because the `next` CLI binary is missing from the local `node_modules` snapshot, so the `next` command cannot be resolved.
- `npm run type-check` fails due to missing type definition bundles for `jest` and `@testing-library/jest-dom`, and because `tsconfig.node.json` referenced from `tsconfig.json` is absent.
- `npm test` fails because the Jest CLI is not present in `node_modules`, so the `jest` executable cannot be found.
- Attempting `npm ci` to restore dependencies terminates with HTTP 403 errors when fetching packages like `react-dom`, indicating the environment cannot reach the npm registry.

## Command Output References
- `npm run lint`: missing `next` CLI (`sh: 1: next: not found`).
- `npm run type-check`: missing type definition files for `jest` and `@testing-library/jest-dom`, plus missing `tsconfig.node.json`.
- `npm test`: missing `jest` CLI (`sh: 1: jest: not found`).
- `npm ci`: HTTP 403 when trying to download packages, preventing dependency installation.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Restore the full dependency tree (including Next.js and Jest) by re-running `npm ci` or `npm install` in an environment with access to the npm registry.
2. Commit or restore the missing `tsconfig.node.json` file so TypeScript project references resolve.
3. Ensure local type definition packages for Jest and Testing Library are available, or provide equivalent manual type declarations.
4. Re-run linting, type checking, and tests once dependencies are in place to confirm the repository is healthy.
