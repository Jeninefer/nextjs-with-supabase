# ABACO Runtime Export Artifacts

The files in this directory are generated by the production Supabase pipelines.
Each sub-folder contains materialized extracts that are synchronized to the
analytics lake every night at 01:00 UTC.  All exports are encrypted at rest and
validated against the governed schemas documented in
[`ABACO_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`](../../ABACO_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md).

| Folder | Contents | Refresh cadence |
| ------ | -------- | --------------- |
| `analytics/` | Curated feature tables for AI workflows | Daily |
| `dpd/` | Delinquency and collections extracts | Hourly |
| `kpi/` | Executive KPI snapshots (includes nested JSON) | Daily |
| `pricing/` | Rate cards and limit assignments | Daily |

Do not commit generated CSV or JSON exports.  The ingestion workers populate the
folders automatically during runtime.
