# DPD Export Channel

This folder captures delinquency metrics sourced from the
`risk_portfolio.delinquency_snapshot` view.  Every CSV contains payer-level
aging buckets with the authoritative `days_past_due` calculations aligned to the
collections dashboards.

Expected files:
- `dpd_snapshot_*.csv`
- `collections_rollup_*.csv`

### Governance
The collections team receives alerts if a refresh is delayed more than 15
minutes.  Manual edits are prohibitedâ€”replace files exclusively via the
Supabase managed task.
