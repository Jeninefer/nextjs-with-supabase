# Fix for Cloud Dataproc API Error

## Problem Statement

The application was encountering the following error:

```
Error listing clusters: Error: Cloud Dataproc API has not been used in project 
gen-lang-client-0516194156 before or it is disabled. Enable it by visiting 
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/dataproc.googleapis.com/overview?project=gen-lang-client-0516194156 
then retry. If you enabled this API recently, wait a few minutes for the action 
to propagate to our systems and retry.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The error was caused by MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integrations attempting to use Google Cloud services that require the Dataproc API. Specifically:

1. Some MCP servers (like `web-search`) use Google Cloud APIs internally
2. These APIs were trying to access Google Cloud Project `gen-lang-client-0516194156`
3. The Dataproc API was not enabled in that project
4. There was no error handling to gracefully handle API unavailability

## Solution Implemented

### 1. MCP Configuration System (`lib/mcp-config.ts`)

Created a centralized configuration system to manage MCP servers:

- **Enable/Disable Servers**: Each server can be individually enabled or disabled
- **Default Safety**: Servers requiring Google Cloud APIs are **disabled by default**
- **Auto-Enable**: Servers auto-enable when their required environment variables are present
- **Clear Documentation**: Each server has a description explaining its purpose

**Key Features:**
```typescript
- fetch: Enabled by default (no auth required)
- memory: Enabled by default (no auth required)
- perplexity-ask: Disabled by default (requires API key)
- brave-search: Disabled by default (requires API key)
- web-search: Disabled by default (uses Google Cloud APIs)
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling (`app/dashboard/financial/hooks/useMCPIntegration.ts`)

Updated the MCP integration hook with comprehensive error handling:

- **Individual Server Isolation**: Failure of one server doesn't affect others
- **Graceful Degradation**: Application continues to function even if all MCP servers fail
- **Google Cloud Detection**: Specific error messages for Google Cloud API issues
- **Informative Logging**: Detailed console output for debugging
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: All server operations wrapped in error handlers

**Error Handling Flow:**
1. Load enabled servers from configuration
2. Try to initialize each server individually
3. Catch and log errors without stopping the process
4. Continue with successfully initialized servers
5. Provide helpful tips for Google Cloud-related errors

### 3. Documentation (`docs/MCP_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)

Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide covering:

- Common error scenarios and solutions
- Environment variable configuration
- How to enable/disable specific servers
- Google Cloud API setup instructions
- Best practices for MCP server management

### 4. Updated README

Added reference to MCP troubleshooting guide in the main README with a specific section for Google Cloud API errors.

### 5. Test Script (`scripts/test-mcp-config.ts`)

Created verification script that tests:

- Configuration loading
- Default server states
- Google Cloud servers are disabled by default
- Enabled server retrieval
- Individual server status checks

## Benefits

### Immediate Benefits

1. ‚úÖ **No More Dataproc Errors**: Google Cloud servers are disabled by default
2. ‚úÖ **Application Continues Working**: Core functionality not affected by API failures
3. ‚úÖ **Better User Experience**: Clear error messages and guidance
4. ‚úÖ **Easy Configuration**: Simple environment variable-based enabling

### Long-Term Benefits

1. üìà **Scalability**: Easy to add new MCP servers
2. üîí **Security**: No hardcoded credentials, environment-based configuration
3. üõ†Ô∏è **Maintainability**: Centralized configuration management
4. üìä **Observability**: Detailed logging for debugging
5. üéØ **Flexibility**: Users can enable only the services they need

## Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:

```
‚úÖ Retrieved configuration with 5 servers defined
‚úÖ 2 server(s) enabled by default (fetch, memory)
‚úÖ All Google Cloud API servers disabled by default
‚úÖ Application builds successfully
‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
‚úÖ Dev server starts without errors
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

No changes required! The application will work out of the box with:
- ‚úÖ Safe MCP servers (fetch, memory) enabled automatically
- ‚úÖ Google Cloud servers disabled (preventing the error)
- ‚úÖ Full backward compatibility

### To Enable Google Cloud Services (Optional)

1. Set up a Google Cloud project
2. Enable required APIs (Custom Search API, etc.)
3. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_engine_id
   ```
4. Servers will auto-enable when credentials are detected

### To Enable Other Services (Optional)

Set the corresponding API keys:
```bash
# Perplexity AI
NEXT_PUBLIC_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_key

# Brave Search
NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAVE_API_KEY=your_key
```

## Files Changed

1. **`lib/mcp-config.ts`** (NEW) - MCP configuration system
2. **`app/dashboard/financial/hooks/useMCPIntegration.ts`** - Enhanced error handling
3. **`docs/MCP_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** (NEW) - Troubleshooting guide
4. **`README.md`** - Added Google Cloud error section
5. **`scripts/test-mcp-config.ts`** (NEW) - Configuration test script

## Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ No credentials hardcoded
- ‚úÖ All API keys from environment variables
- ‚úÖ Services disabled by default
- ‚úÖ Explicit opt-in required for external services
- ‚úÖ Try-catch blocks prevent crashes
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data logged

## Summary

The Cloud Dataproc API error has been **completely resolved** by:

1. Implementing a robust MCP configuration system
2. Adding comprehensive error handling
3. Disabling Google Cloud services by default
4. Providing clear documentation and troubleshooting guides
5. Creating tests to verify the solution

The application now works seamlessly without requiring Google Cloud API access, while still allowing users to optionally enable those features when needed.
