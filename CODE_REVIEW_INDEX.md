## üí° PRO TIPS

1. **Start Small**: Don't implement everything at once. Follow the 4-phase roadmap.

2. **High ROI First**: Start with Continue Learning + Risk Model (Week 1). Unblocks others.

3. **Test As You Go**: Don't wait until the end. Write tests for each component.

4. **Get Feedback Early**: Show cascade view prototype by end of Week 2. Get team input.

5. **Document Changes**: Keep README.md and architecture docs updated as you build.

6. **Monitor Performance**: Use the performance benchmarking in Week 5 to identify bottlenecks.

7. **Celebrate Milestones**: Demo after each week to keep team engaged and motivated.
