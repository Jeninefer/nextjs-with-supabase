# Multi-Container Application Placeholder

This repository previously referenced a Git submodule at `multi-container-app`.
The submodule reference has been removed to prevent CI errors caused by the
missing `.gitmodules` entry. The directory now serves as a placeholder for
future multi-container assets. Add project files here directly rather than
relying on an external submodule.
