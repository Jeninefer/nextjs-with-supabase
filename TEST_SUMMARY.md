### 2. `data/pull_requests.json`
**Test File:** `__tests__/data/pull_requests.test.ts`
- **Lines of Code:** 357 lines
- **Test Cases:** 37 comprehensive validation tests
- **Describe Blocks:** 9 organized test suites

#### Validation Coverage Categories:

##### File Structure and Syntax (4 tests)
- ✅ Is valid JSON
- ✅ Is an array at the root level
- ✅ Contains at least one pull request
- ✅ Does not contain null or undefined entries

##### Schema Validation (8 tests)
- ✅ All entries have required fields (number, title, assignees, status)
- ✅ Number field is a positive integer
- ✅ Title field is a non-empty string
- ✅ Assignees field is an array
- ✅ All assignees are non-empty strings
- ✅ Status field is a valid value (open/closed)
- ✅ Optional duplicateOf field is a positive integer when present
- ✅ Optional closureReason field is a non-empty string when present

##### Data Integrity (6 tests)
- ✅ All pull request numbers are unique
- ✅ Pull request numbers are sorted in descending order
- ✅ Closed PRs with duplicateOf reference existing PR numbers
- ✅ Closed PRs with duplicateOf do not reference themselves
- ✅ PRs with duplicateOf reference a lower PR number (canonical)
- ✅ No duplicate titles among open PRs

##### Business Rules (6 tests)
- ✅ Closed PRs have a closure reason
- ✅ Duplicate-ai-assignee closure reasons are only for closed PRs
- ✅ PRs marked as duplicates have valid canonical references
- ✅ At least one PR has assignees
- ✅ Assignee names do not contain leading/trailing whitespace
- ✅ Title does not contain excessive whitespace

##### Type Compatibility (2 tests)
- ✅ Can be cast to PullRequestRecord[] without errors
- ✅ All entries conform to PullRequestRecord interface

##### Realistic Data Validation (4 tests)
- ✅ PR numbers are in a reasonable range
- ✅ Titles are of reasonable length
- ✅ Number of assignees is reasonable
- ✅ Assignee names are of reasonable length

##### Specific Data Entries (3 tests)
- ✅ Contains PR #102 as specified in tests
- ✅ Contains PR #105 marked as duplicate of #102
- ✅ All PRs have consistent assignee lists format

##### JSON Formatting and Consistency (3 tests)
- ✅ Uses consistent indentation
- ✅ Does not have trailing commas
- ✅ Uses double quotes for strings

## Test Framework & Tools
- **Testing Framework:** Jest (v29.7.0)
- **Testing Libraries:** @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom
- **Test Environment:** jest-environment-jsdom
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Path Aliases:** @/ (repository root)

## Best Practices Implemented

### Code Quality
✅ Clean, readable, and maintainable test code  
✅ Descriptive test names that clearly communicate purpose  
✅ Organized into logical describe blocks  
✅ Consistent naming conventions  
✅ No new dependencies introduced

### Test Coverage
✅ Happy path scenarios  
✅ Edge cases and boundary conditions  
✅ Failure conditions  
✅ Data validation and schema checks  
✅ Immutability guarantees  
✅ Type safety validation

### Testing Patterns
✅ Arrange-Act-Assert pattern  
✅ Setup with beforeAll/beforeEach where appropriate  
✅ Pure function testing with no side effects  
✅ Mocking not required (pure functions tested)  
✅ Comprehensive assertions for all return values

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test __tests__/lib/pull-request-maintenance.test.ts
npm test __tests__/data/pull_requests.test.ts

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Value |

## Key Features Tested

### Pull Request Maintenance
1. **Duplicate Detection:** Case-insensitive title matching with normalization
2. **AI Assignment Detection:** Flexible, configurable AI identifier matching
3. **Canonical Selection:** Lowest PR number becomes canonical
4. **Immutability:** Original data structures never modified
5. **Closure Metadata:** Proper tracking of duplicates and reasons
6. **Edge Cases:** Empty arrays, non-sequential ordering, pre-closed PRs

### Data Validation
1. **Schema Compliance:** All fields present with correct types
2. **Data Integrity:** Unique IDs, valid references, proper sorting
3. **Business Logic:** Closure reasons, duplicate tracking, canonical references
4. **Format Consistency:** JSON structure, indentation, quotes
5. **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript interface compatibility
6. **Realistic Constraints:** Reasonable ranges for all values

## Notes

- All tests follow the existing project conventions
- Tests use the established Jest setup from the repository
- No new dependencies were added
- Tests are designed to be maintainable and easily extendable
- Each test is independent and can run in isolation
- Tests provide clear failure messages for debugging
- Comprehensive coverage ensures confidence in code changes
