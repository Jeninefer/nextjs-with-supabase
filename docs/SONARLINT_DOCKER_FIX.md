# SonarLint Docker Spawn Error Fix

## Issue Description
When opening this project in VSCode with the SonarLint extension installed, the extension attempted to start a SonarQube server using Docker, which resulted in the following error:

```
2025-10-22 09:15:57.687 [info] Connection state: Error spawn docker ENOENT
```

This error occurred because:
1. The SonarLint extension was trying to spawn a Docker process
2. Docker was not found in the PATH or was not accessible to the VSCode extension
3. The extension was configured to use connected mode with a Docker-based SonarQube server

## Solution
The fix involved two changes to the VSCode workspace configuration:

### 1. Added SonarLint to Extension Recommendations
Updated `.vscode/extensions.json` to include the SonarLint extension:
```json
"sonarsource.sonarlint-vscode"
```

### 2. Configured SonarLint for Standalone Mode
Updated `.vscode/settings.json` to configure SonarLint to run in standalone mode without requiring a Docker-based SonarQube server:

```json
{
    "sonarlint.connectedMode.servers": [],
    "sonarlint.disableTelemetry": true,
    "sonarlint.output.showAnalyzerLogs": false,
    "sonarlint.rules": {}
}
```

**Key Configuration Details:**
- `sonarlint.connectedMode.servers: []` - Disables connected mode, preventing the extension from trying to connect to a SonarQube server
- `sonarlint.disableTelemetry: true` - Disables telemetry collection for privacy
- `sonarlint.output.showAnalyzerLogs: false` - Reduces noise in the output logs
- `sonarlint.rules: {}` - Uses default rules (can be customized later)

## Benefits
- ✅ SonarLint now runs in standalone mode without requiring Docker
- ✅ Code analysis still works for TypeScript, JavaScript, and other supported languages
- ✅ No dependency on external SonarQube server
- ✅ Faster startup time as no Docker container needs to be spawned
- ✅ Works in environments where Docker may not be available

## Verification
After applying this fix:
1. The project builds successfully (`npm run build`)
2. Type checking passes (`npm run type-check`)
3. No Docker spawn errors occur when opening the project in VSCode
4. SonarLint provides inline code quality feedback in standalone mode

## Alternative Approaches (Not Implemented)
If you need connected mode with a SonarQube server in the future, you can:
1. Ensure Docker is installed and accessible in your PATH
2. Configure `sonarlint.connectedMode.servers` with your SonarQube server details
3. Set up proper authentication credentials

For most development workflows, standalone mode is sufficient and recommended.
