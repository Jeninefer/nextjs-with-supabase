# GitHub Copilot CLI (Public Preview)

## üöÄ Overview
GitHub Copilot CLI brings the GitHub Copilot coding agent directly into your terminal, so you can build, debug, and understand code without leaving the command line. It combines terminal-native workflows with deep GitHub integration and agentic capabilities that can plan and execute complex development tasks.

### Key Capabilities
- **Terminal-native development**: Collaborate with the Copilot coding agent entirely within your shell.
- **Built-in GitHub integration**: Access repositories, issues, and pull requests using natural language, authenticated with your GitHub account.
- **Agentic workflow support**: Ask the agent to build, edit, refactor, or debug code while previewing every action before it runs.
- **MCP-powered extensibility**: Extend Copilot with additional Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, including the default GitHub MCP server.
- **Full execution control**: Review and approve every command before it executes locally.

## üß∞ Supported Platforms & Prerequisites
GitHub Copilot CLI is available on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Before installing, ensure you have:

## üì¶ Installation
Install the CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

## üö™ Launching the CLI
Start GitHub Copilot CLI from the terminal in the folder that contains the code you want to work with:

```bash
copilot
```

The first launch displays an animated welcome banner. To view it again later, re-run Copilot with the `--banner` flag:

```bash
copilot --banner
```

## üîê Authentication
If you are not logged in, Copilot prompts you to authenticate using the `/login` slash command. Follow the on-screen steps to authorize your GitHub account.

### Authenticating with a Personal Access Token (PAT)
You can authenticate using a fine-grained PAT that has the **Copilot Requests** permission:

1. Visit <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>.
2. Under **Permissions**, select **Copilot Requests**.
3. Generate the token.
4. Export it as an environment variable:
   - `GH_TOKEN` (preferred)
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` (fallback)

## üß† Choosing Models
Copilot CLI defaults to **Claude Sonnet 4.5**. Run the `/model` slash command to explore other available models, such as Claude Sonnet 4 or GPT-5, and select the one that best fits your task.

## üí° Usage Tips
- Launch Copilot in the repository or project directory you want to work with so the agent can leverage local context.
- Interact through natural language prompts and slash commands.
- Preview and approve every action suggested by the agent to maintain full control over your environment.

> **Note on Quotas:** Each prompt consumes one premium request from your monthly Copilot allocation. Refer to GitHub's documentation on premium requests if you need more details about consumption and limits.
