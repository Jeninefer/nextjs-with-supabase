# Cloud Code Command Fix - Issue Resolution

## Problem Statement

Users encountered the error:
```
Actual command not found, wanted to execute cloudcode.duetAI.inEditor.fix /587
```

This error occurred when trying to use Google Cloud Code's Duet AI features in VS Code, specifically the in-editor fix command.

## Root Cause

The Google Cloud Code extension was not installed or configured in the project. The command `cloudcode.duetAI.inEditor.fix` requires:

1. The Google Cloud Code extension to be installed in VS Code
2. Proper authentication with Google Cloud
3. Access to Duet AI features

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Extension Configuration
Added `googlecloudtools.cloudcode` to the recommended extensions list in `.vscode/extensions.json`. This ensures:
- VS Code will prompt users to install the extension when opening the project
- New team members will automatically be guided to install required tools
- The development environment is consistent across all contributors

### 2. VS Code Settings
Added Cloud Code-specific settings in `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
    "cloudcode.duetAI.enabled": true,
    "cloudcode.duetAI.inlineCompletions.enabled": true,
    "cloudcode.autoDependencies": "on"
}
```

These settings:
- Enable Duet AI features by default
- Turn on inline code completions for better productivity
- Automatically manage Cloud Code dependencies

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts
Created `.vscode/keybindings.json` with convenient shortcuts for common Duet AI commands:
- `Ctrl+Shift+F`: Fix code issues
- `Ctrl+Shift+E`: Explain code
- `Ctrl+Shift+G`: Generate code

> **Note:**  
> Ensure that these keyboard shortcuts are kept consistent across all documentation files, including `docs/CLOUD_CODE_SETUP.md` (see lines 34, 39, 44) and `.vscode/keybindings.json`.  
> If you update shortcuts here, update them everywhere to avoid confusion.
### 4. Comprehensive Documentation
Created `docs/CLOUD_CODE_SETUP.md` that includes:
- Step-by-step installation instructions
- Authentication guide for Google Cloud
- Usage examples for all Duet AI commands
- Detailed troubleshooting section
- Project-specific integration notes

### 5. README Update
Updated the main README.md to reference the Cloud Code setup guide in the troubleshooting section.

## How to Use

### For New Users

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. When prompted, click "Install" to add recommended extensions
3. After Cloud Code installs, click the status bar item to sign in to Google Cloud
4. Once authenticated, all Duet AI commands will be available

### Using Duet AI Commands

**Method 1: Keyboard Shortcuts**
- Select code that needs fixing
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+F` (Mac)
- Duet AI will suggest fixes

**Method 2: Command Palette**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`
- Type "Duet AI: Fix"
- Select the command

**Method 3: Context Menu**
- Right-click on selected code
- Look for "Duet AI" options in the context menu

## Verification

All changes have been validated:
- ✅ All JSON configuration files are valid
- ✅ Project builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Linting passes without errors (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities introduced
- ✅ Documentation is clear and comprehensive

## Files Changed

1. `.vscode/extensions.json` - Added Cloud Code extension
2. `.vscode/settings.json` - Added Duet AI configuration
3. `.vscode/keybindings.json` - New file with keyboard shortcuts
4. `docs/CLOUD_CODE_SETUP.md` - New comprehensive documentation
5. `README.md` - Added reference to Cloud Code documentation

## Expected Outcome

After these changes:
- The "command not found" error will no longer occur once Cloud Code is installed
- Users will be automatically prompted to install the required extension
- Duet AI features will work seamlessly for code fixes, explanations, and generation
- The development experience will be more productive with AI assistance

## Additional Notes

- Cloud Code extension requires VS Code version 1.70.0 or later
- Duet AI features may require specific Google Cloud organization permissions
- Users must have an active Google Cloud account with Duet AI access
- The extension works best with an active internet connection for AI features
