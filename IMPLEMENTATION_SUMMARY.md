# Google Cloud Deployment - Implementation Summary

## Problem Addressed

The issue was related to insufficient Google Cloud Platform (GCP) IAM permissions when attempting to deploy the ABACO Financial Intelligence Platform. The specific error encountered was:

```
You need additional access to the project: gen-lang-client-0516194156
Missing or blocked permissions: resourcemanager.projects.get
```

## Solution Implemented

This PR provides a comprehensive solution for deploying the ABACO platform to Google Cloud Run, including proper documentation and tooling to handle IAM permission issues.

## Files Added

### 1. Configuration Files

- **`cloudbuild.yaml`** - Google Cloud Build configuration for automated CI/CD
- **`Dockerfile`** - Multi-stage Docker build optimized for Cloud Run
- **`.dockerignore`** - Excludes unnecessary files from Docker builds
- **`.env.gcp.example`** - Example environment variables for GCP deployment

### 2. Documentation

- **`docs/GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md`** - Comprehensive setup guide covering:
  - IAM permissions and roles
  - Required Google Cloud APIs
  - Service account setup
  - Deployment steps
  - Troubleshooting common issues (including the reported permission error)
  
- **`GOOGLE_CLOUD_QUICK_START.md`** - Quick reference guide with:
  - Fast solutions for permission issues
  - Common commands
  - Quick troubleshooting tips

### 3. Deployment Scripts

- **`scripts/deploy-gcp.sh`** - Automated deployment script that:
  - Checks for gcloud CLI installation
  - Verifies authentication
  - Validates project access and permissions
  - Enables required APIs
  - Deploys to Cloud Run
  
- **`scripts/check-gcp-permissions.sh`** - Diagnostic tool that:
  - Checks IAM permissions
  - Verifies API access
  - Lists user roles
  - Provides actionable recommendations

### 4. Configuration Updates

- **`next.config.ts`** - Added `output: "standalone"` for Docker/Cloud Run deployment
- **`.gitignore`** - Added entries for production env files and Google Cloud directories
- **`README.md`** - Updated deployment section with GCP setup instructions

## How It Solves the Problem

### For the Reported Permission Issue

The documentation (`docs/GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md`) provides three solutions:

1. **Request Access**: Step-by-step instructions for requesting proper IAM roles from the project administrator
2. **Use Troubleshooting Tool**: Guidance on using GCP's IAM troubleshooter
3. **Create New Project**: Instructions to create a new project where the user has Owner permissions

### Automated Assistance

The deployment scripts automatically:
- Detect permission issues and provide specific error messages
- Suggest required roles and permissions
- Guide users through the resolution process
- Verify all prerequisites before attempting deployment

## Required Permissions

The solution documents the minimum required permissions:

- **Viewer Role**: For basic project access (includes `resourcemanager.projects.get`)
- **Editor Role**: Recommended for deployment (includes all necessary permissions)
- **Specific Roles**: `roles/run.developer`, `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`, `roles/storage.admin`

## Usage

### Quick Deploy
```bash
./scripts/deploy-gcp.sh
```

### Check Permissions
```bash
./scripts/check-gcp-permissions.sh
```

### Manual Deploy
```bash
gcloud run deploy abaco-platform --source . --region us-central1
```

## Testing

- ✅ Next.js build with standalone output tested successfully
- ✅ ESLint validation passed
- ✅ Configuration files validated
- ✅ Scripts made executable
- ✅ Documentation reviewed for accuracy

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Addresses the specific permission error and provides multiple solutions
2. **Automated Tooling**: Scripts reduce manual steps and catch issues early
3. **Best Practices**: Implements security best practices for Cloud Run deployment
4. **Developer Experience**: Clear error messages and actionable guidance
5. **Production Ready**: Multi-stage Docker build optimized for performance

## Next Steps for Users

1. Review `GOOGLE_CLOUD_QUICK_START.md` for immediate solutions
2. Read `docs/GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md` for comprehensive setup instructions
3. Run `scripts/check-gcp-permissions.sh` to diagnose permission issues
4. Use `scripts/deploy-gcp.sh` for automated deployment
