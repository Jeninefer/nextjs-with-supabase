## 🔴 CRITICAL GAPS (Must Fix)

### 1. **Continue Learning Not Implemented** 
**Impact**: AI models never improve over time
**Effort**: 30-40 hours
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL

```
❌ No prediction tracking
❌ No feedback loops
❌ No model weight adjustment
❌ No performance metrics dashboard
```

### 2. **Interactive Agents Are Static**
**Impact**: 8 agents exist only on paper
**Effort**: 40-50 hours
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL

```
❌ No system prompts
❌ No inter-agent communication
❌ No role-specific behavior
❌ No fallback chain
```

### 3. **Cascade View Missing**
**Impact**: Can't see decision hierarchy
**Effort**: 20-30 hours
**Priority**: 🔴 HIGH

```
❌ No visualization layer
❌ No consensus metrics
❌ No dissent tracking
```

### 4. **Integrations Not Functional**
**Impact**: Platform is isolated, can't sync with other systems
**Effort**: 80-100 hours
**Priority**: 🔴 HIGH

```
❌ HubSpot: 0% implemented (need CRM sync)
❌ Slack: 0% implemented (need alerts)
❌ Gmail: 0% implemented (need archive)
❌ Drive: 0% implemented (need export)
❌ Zapier: 0% implemented (need automation)
```

### 5. **Risk Model Too Simplistic**
**Impact**: Only considers DPD, misses portfolio complexity
**Effort**: 20-30 hours
**Priority**: 🔴 HIGH

```
❌ No multi-factor scoring
❌ No trend analysis
❌ No risk alerts/actions
❌ No configurable thresholds
```

- ✅ Make AI agents truly interactive
- ✅ Implement continuous learning
- ✅ Connect to HubSpot, Slack, Drive, etc.
- ✅ Build a production-ready platform
- ✅ Achieve 85%+ test coverage

### Recommended First Step
**Start with Continue Learning + Agent Framework** (Week 1-2)
- Highest impact on platform intelligence
- Unblocks other features
- Visible user improvements quickly
- Strong ROI
