Clarify the purpose and correct the content of CODE_REVIEW_AUTOMATION.md.

This file appears to have encoding or translation issues and is out of scope for the PR objectives (which focus only on README roadmap updates). The content contains multiple errors flagged by static analysis, and garbled text like "usca," "automextracci√≥n," and malformed structure throughout.

Before merging:

- Clarify whether this file should be included in this PR (not mentioned in PR objectives).
- If intentional, provide corrected English-language content with clear configuration instructions.
- If accidental, remove this file and rebase the branch.

This file as-is will confuse users and does not meet documentation standards.
