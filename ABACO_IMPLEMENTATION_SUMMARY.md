# ABACO Runtime & Data Operations Summary

## Overview

This document captures the current state and near-term roadmap for the ABACO Financial Intelligence Platform's runtime analytics pipeline. It focuses on how export artifacts are organized, how data will move from Supabase into downstream analytics systems, and the operational guardrails that keep the platform production ready.

## Implemented

### Runtime Export Topology
- `abaco_runtime/exports/analytics/` – Aggregated analytics bundles prepared for business stakeholders.
- `abaco_runtime/exports/dpd/` – Delinquency (days-past-due) extracts for risk teams.
- `abaco_runtime/exports/kpi/` & `abaco_runtime/exports/kpi/json/` – KPI snapshots in tabular and JSON formats for UI hydration.
- `abaco_runtime/exports/pricing/` – Revenue enablement datasets for pricing strategists.

Each directory is tracked via a `.gitkeep` placeholder, ensuring version control retains the scaffold without committing environment-specific output.

### Application Platform
- Next.js 15 frontend with Supabase authentication and role-based access patterns.
- Supabase Edge Functions powering AI summarization workflows and secure data access.
- Deployment targets validated on Vercel with optional container-based deployments.

## In Progress

### Supabase → Lakehouse Ingestion Pipeline
- **Status:** Design approved, implementation scheduled.
- **Scope:** Automate CDC ingestion from Supabase tables into an analytics lakehouse using scheduled export jobs and transformation workflows.
- **Artifacts:** Design notes, schema mappings, and orchestration plan tracked in issues `#96` and `#102`.

### Observability & Compliance Enhancements
- **Status:** Requirements gathered.
- **Scope:** Add audit logging for export jobs, retention policies for generated artifacts, and health checks for pipeline services.

## Next Steps

1. Finalize infrastructure IaC templates for the ingestion pipeline (Terraform modules for storage buckets, Pub/Sub topics, and service accounts).
2. Implement job runners responsible for exporting Supabase data into the structured directories above.
3. Add monitoring dashboards (Grafana + Supabase logs) and alerting thresholds for failed exports.
4. Document operational runbooks for on-call analysts and platform engineers.
